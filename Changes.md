## 1.91 Mon Jun 24 22:00:13 CEST 2024

Due to a mistake with the release numbering, the two trial releases, should not have been `1.10` and `1.11`, but `1.91` and `1.92` respectively. So there will be a jump from 1.9 to 1.91, since 1.9 is equivalent to 1.90.

This release contains changes tested on the two previous trial releases.

- PR: [#47](https://github.com/dsully/perl-crypt-openssl-pkcs12/pull/47) from @timlegge, improving support for building with OpenSSL located in non-standard locations
